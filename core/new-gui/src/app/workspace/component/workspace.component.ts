     *    which is an empty workflow with undefined id. This workflow will be cached in localStorage upon initialization.
     *    - After an Auto-persist being triggered by a workspace event, it will create a new workflow in the database
     *    and update the cached workflow with its new ID from database.
     * 2. Accessed by URL `/`, with a workflow cached (refresh manually, or create new workflow button):
     *    - This will trigger the WorkflowCacheService to load the workflow from cache. It can be linked to the database if the cached
     *    workflow has ID.
     *    - After an Auto-persist being triggered by a workspace event, if not having an ID, it will create a new workflow in the database
     *    and update the cached workflow with its new ID from database.
     * 3. Accessed by URL `/workflow/:id` (refresh manually, or jump from dashboard workflow list):
     *    - No matter if there exists a cached workflow, it will retrieves the workflow from database with the given ID. the cached workflow
     *    will be overwritten. Because it has an ID, it will be linked to the database
     *    - Auto-persist will be triggered upon all workspace events.
